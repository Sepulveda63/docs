## Free Virtual Machines

Webapp.io gives you access to free virtual machines that you can use to deploy a custom application on a custom domain. 

Our VM's automatically hibernate after 30 minutes of inactivity, but with our proprietary snapshotting technology, we are able to wake up our VM's so the response delay is less than a few seconds.

Our virtual machines are available for 750 hours a month (which spans an entire month). Webapp.io monitors usage, including the number of virtual machines deployed, to prevent spam and overload on the system. 

<Warning>
If you are misusing the virtual machines, webapp.io will ban you from the system permanently.
