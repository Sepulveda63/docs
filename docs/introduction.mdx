## What is webapp.io?

We integrate with an existing repository on GitHub, GitLab, or
Bitbucket to provide customizable full-stack preview environments directly into
every pull request.

1. Install webapp.io onto your repository
2. Add a [Layerfile](../layerfile-reference/intro) (a set of instructions that
   tells webapp.io how to setup and run your application)
3. Get a preview environment for every commit

Every time you push a new change, webapp.io leverages snapshots to create new
copies of virtual machines (not containers!) in seconds by re-using instructions
that have not been updated.

As an example, instead of running `npm install` for every push you make,
webapp.io takes a snapshot so that on a subsequent push we can skip the
`npm install` step (unless your dependencies have changed).

### Beyond Preview Environments

Webapp.io is well suited for creating full-stack preview environment for every
commit, but that’s far from the only thing it can do! We also support the
following:

- Pull Request Template Builder (create a template to access important
  information for your webapp directly from your pull request)
- Polyrepositories (if you have multiple repo's running your project, we support
  it)
- Preview Environments on your Domain
- OAuth (logging in with external sites)

And much more! Check out our [Advanced Workflows](/advanced-workflows/duplicate-vm) documentation for more information.

If you'd like to make any improvements to these docs, you can
[edit these docs](https://github.com/webappio/docs/tree/master/home) directly.

Happy coding!

## Livechat Example Walkthrough

### 1. Fork Example Repo

Screenshot after clicking on the button in GitHub to fork the repository.

### 2. Clone To Local

Clone the new Livechat Example repository to your local machine.

<img class="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/clone-locally.png" />

Click on the "Code" button to get the URL to clone locally.

```bash Shell
git clone (INSERT URL HERE)
```

### 3. Sign up to webapp.io

[Sign up to webapp.io](https://webapp.io/sign-up) and install webapp.io on your GitHub account, **ensuring that webapp.io has access to the repository you created.**

### 4. Make a Local Change

Make a change to the project locally, and push your changes to the repository you created.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "making some change to Livechat example"
git push
```

### 5. View Website

Go to your dashboard on webapp.io to see your run, click on “Details”,“main-layerfile”, then “View website”.

<img class="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/run-page.png" />

<img class="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/detail-page.png" />

Click on "main-layerfile" here, followed by "View Website".

### 6. View Preview Environment

Wait for the server to start, you'll be redirected to a preview environment with the Livechat Example.

<img
  class="rounded"
  src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/livechat-example.png"
/>

That's all you need to view the full-stack preview environment with webapp.io!
Next, try making another change to one of the views (i.e., in
`/services/web/src/views/login/login.js`) and push a new commit to see another
preview environment with your changes.

## Quickstart

To view the power of preview environments in action, let's go through an example
with our open-source version of Slack,
[Livechat Example](https://github.com/webappio/livechat-example), that uses
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). For the purpose of this
quickstart guide, the codebase is monorepository, so all of the services are
within a single folder (/services).

Our Livechat Example contains the following within the `/services` folder:

- `/api` (our api to handle all requests)
- `/cypress` (for running tests)
- `/migrate` (for populating our database)
- `/web` (our React frontend)

Most importantly, in the root directory, we have our **Layerfile** which is a
**set of instructions that tells webapp.io how to install, build, and run** the
Livechat Example. This Layerfile for our Livechat example is shown below:

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# Install docker
RUN apt-get update && \
apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common && \
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add - && \
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable" && \
apt-get update && \
apt install docker-ce

# Install docker-compose
RUN curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Copy repository files
COPY / /root

RUN /root/pull-images.sh
RUN REPEATABLE docker-compose build --parallel
RUN BACKGROUND docker-compose up

# EXPOSE WEBSITE creates an internet visible link
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:8000

```

## Limits

### General Limits

The following general limits are applied to all Webapp.io accounts to prevent
abuse.

## Snapshots & Snapshot Retention

A snapshot is a copy of a virtual machine at a specific moment in time. Snapshots help to load environments and configurations so that you can skip
running steps that have not changed or that have successfully executed on
previous commits.

### Algorithm for Deleting Snapshots

Listed below is a summary of how we delete snapshots. It's important to review
this to learn the states of snapshots at different times.

1. Split important snapshots into VIP, Important, and Not Important (VIP as the top tier).

Important Snapshots:

- Newer than 10 minutes
- Newer than a week old and the latest snapshot for an instruction
- Newer than a week old and contains the [EXPOSE WEBSITE](./layerfile-reference/expose-website) instruction for an open pull request.

VIP Snapshots:

- 30 prioritized snapshots per paying customer as determined by tier and how
  recent the snapshots are

2. Order Snapshot Importance (VIP, Important, Not Important)

3. Delete Snapshots

Delete Process:

- Delete the oldest not important
- Delete the oldest important
- Delete the oldest VIP

## Environmental Lifecycle

Environments (Layerfiles with [EXPOSE WEBSITE](./layerfile-reference/expose-website), Layerfiles that expose a debug terminal, etc.) have three lifecycle levels:

- _Deleted_, which means you can't start them without rebuilding (rebuilding deletes
  everything, like your temporary database, registered user, and state in the environment).
- _Stopped_, which means you see a spinner as they start - _Running_, which means
  it's currently running

### Running to Stopped

The Running lifecycle to Stopped lifecycle happens for a few reasons:

- After 3 minutes of inactivity if there are builds queued
- After 60 minutes in general (this can be changed by our admin team if
  requested)

### Stopped to Deleted

The Stopped lifectyle to Deleted lifecycle happens for two reasons:

- Something crashes (rare)
- Snapshot is deleted (see [Snapshots & Snapshot Retention](/introduction#snapshots-and-snapshot-retention)
