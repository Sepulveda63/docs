<Warning>

CLONE is only available if "Use new hypervisor" is enabled in [your
organization's settings](https://webapp.io/dashboard/org-settings).

</Warning>

`CLONE [repository URL] (DEFAULT=branch-name) (files...) [destination]`

The `CLONE` instruction moves files from a repository to the runner.

Files can be:

- relative (to the layerfile location for sources, and WORKDIR location, or
  /root if not specified for destination)
- absolute (from the root of the repository for sources, and filesystem root for
  destination)

The `CLONE` directive will automatically add authentication credentials if your account
is connected with the associated repository.

If the current Layerfile's branch is, e.g., `feat-1`, then `CLONE` will try to
check out the `feat-1` branch from `[repository URL]`. If that branch doesn't
exist, it will fall back to the branch specified by `DEFAULT=`.

This facilitates multi-repository development by allowing changes to be made to
libraries concurrently without needing them to be merged to be used.

`CLONE` watches files in the same manner as `COPY`, this means that steps will
only re-run if files in the cloned repository change.

### Examples

- Use `CLONE https://github.com/webappio/library.git DEFAULT=master /library` to
  clone the current branch (e.g., feat-1) if it exists, falling back to master
  otherwise to the `/library` directory in the runner.
- Use `CLONE https://github.com/my-project/hello.git /hello-project` to copy the
  entire repository contents to the destination `/hello-project` in the runner.
- Use
  `CLONE https://github.com/my-project/hello.git DEFAULT=main /package.json /package-lock.json ./`
  to copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from the specified project,
  into the working directory in the runner.
