`SPLIT [n]`

The `SPLIT` instruction causes the runner to duplicate its entire state a number
of times at a specific point. Each copy of the runner will have `SPLIT` and
`SPLIT_NUM` environment variables automatically set. The former will be the
index of the runner, and the latter will be the number of copies.

### Examples

- Use `SPLIT 3` and three copies of the runner will have
  `ENV SPLIT=0 SPLIT_NUM=3` and `ENV SPLIT=1 SPLIT_NUM=3` and so on.
