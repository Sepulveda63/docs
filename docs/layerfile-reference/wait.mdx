`WAIT [layerfile paths...]`

The `WAIT` instruction allows you to make one step require other steps to
succeed before running.

It's especially useful for conditional actions like executing notifications,
deployment, and CI/CD.

### Examples

#### Continuous deployment with WAIT

```docker Layerfile
# at deploy/Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# Wait for the layerfiles at /unit-tests/Layerfile and /acceptance-tests/Layerfile
WAIT /unit-tests /acceptance-tests

RUN ./notify-slack.sh
RUN ./deploy.sh
```

#### Conditional deployment with WAIT and BUTTON

```docker Layerfile
# at deploy/Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# Wait for the layerfiles at /unit-tests/Layerfile and /acceptance-tests/Layerfile
WAIT /unit-tests /acceptance-tests

RUN ./notify-slack.sh
BUTTON deploy?
RUN ./deploy.sh
```

#### What the job view will look like with WAIT

- Notice that deploy only occurs after all of the other layerfiles have
  succeeded.
