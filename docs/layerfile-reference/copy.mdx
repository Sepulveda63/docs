`COPY [files...] [destination]`

The `COPY` instruction moves files from your repository to the runner.

Files can be:

- relative (to the layerfile location for sources, and WORKDIR location, or
  /root if not specified for destination)
- absolute (from the root of the repository for sources, and filesystem root for
  destination)

### Examples

- Use `COPY . .` to copy the directory containing the Layerfile to the current
  working directory (or /root if WORKDIR has not been used)
- Use `COPY package.json yarn.lock ./` to copy those two files to the current
  directory.
- Use `COPY / /root` to copy the entire repository to /root in the runner.
