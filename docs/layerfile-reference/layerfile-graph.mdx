Consider these three Layerfiles:

##### 1. Layerfile at (repo root)/Layerfile

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install postgresql python3
```

##### 2. Layerfile at (repo root)/web/tests/Layerfile

```docker Layerfile
FROM /Layerfile
COPY /web .
RUN ./unittest.sh
```

##### 3. Layerfile at (repo root)/web/Layerfile

```docker Layerfile
FROM /Layerfile
COPY /web .
RUN BACKGROUND ./start-webserver.sh
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:8080
```

When built, these three Layerfiles will automatically combine into a build
graph:

Here, webapp.io has searched for files named 'Layerfile', discovered all three
of these files, and linked them based on their parents (by their FROM lines)

There are many directives which can change the Layerfile graph, see `SPLIT`,
`BUTTON`, and `WAIT` below for some examples.
