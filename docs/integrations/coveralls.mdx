[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) is a hosted service designed to provide code
coverage analytics.

Some key features include: repository coverage statistics, coverage reports,
line-by-line coverage, repository overviews, coverage updates, and GitHub
notices.

It's easy to get started with simple step-by-step instructions and built-in
integrations with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

   CI_BRANCH="$GIT_BRANCH" \\
