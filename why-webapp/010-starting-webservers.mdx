## 1. It's hard to start webservers in traditional CI

After setting up CI/CD for a webapp, the next step is often creating a copy of the entire app in order to run end-to-end tests.

Without webapp.io, there are two common approaches to doing this in CI:

- Use your production cloud provider, and create staging environments ($$$, slow)
- Start the stack for the duration of the pipeline (slow, hard to debug)

**How webapp.io solves this problem:**

Instead of using a YAML file to configure CI/CD in webapp.io, our users create a Layerfile. Here's an example:

<br/>

```Layerfile
FROM vm/node:14
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
RUN BACKGROUND npm run start
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:3000
```

<br/>

This syntax is borrowed from Docker's configuration, and makes it really easy to speed up builds.
In this case, we'd skip running `npm install` for subsequent pipelines unless you change `package.json`.
