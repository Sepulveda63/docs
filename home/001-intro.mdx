## What is webapp.io?

Webapp.io enables you to review changes to your projects within minutes instead of hours. We integrate with
an
existing repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitucket to provide customizable full-stack review environments
directly into every pull request.

</div>

1. Install webapp.io onto your repository
2. Add a [Layerfile](/docs/layerfile-reference/intro) (a set of instructions that tells webapp.io
   how
   to setup and run your application)
3. Get a preview environment for every commit

<br/>
Every time you push a new change, webapp.io leverages snapshots to create new copies of virtual machines
(not
containers!) in seconds by re-using instructions that have not been updated.

As an example, instead of running “npm install” for every push you make, webapp.io takes a snapshot so that
on a
subsequent push we can skip the “npm install” step (unless your dependencies have changed).

## Beyond Review Environments

Webapp.io is well suited for creating full-stack review environment for every commit, but that’s far from
the
only thing it can do! We also support the following:

- Pull Request Template Builder (create a template to access important information for your webapp directly
  from
  your pull request)
- Polyrepositories (if you have multiple repo’s running your project, we support it)
- Review Environments on your Domain
- OAuth (logging in with external sites)

And much more! Check out our <a href="/docs/advanced-workflows">Advanced Workflows</a> documentation for
more
information.
