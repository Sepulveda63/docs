# Deployments

[EXPOSE WEBSITE](/docs/layerfile-reference/expose-website) allows you to whitelabel staging servers on your own domain.

For example, `example.com` could route `$branch.demo.example.com` to the latest commit on the branch `$branch` by adding a single DNS record `CNAME *.demo demotarget.webapp.io`

<br />

**How to set up deployments:**

Using [webapp.io/dashboard](/dashboard), navigate to your customs domains.

<br />

Add the specific domain that you want everything to be exposed under. In the example below, we are adding cidemolocal.co. A CNAME record will be provided.

<br />

Add the CNAME record in your DNS hosting provider (ex: Cloudflare, godaddy, etc). Creating a new record can usually be done within the DNS settings. Once this is done, DNS IS SET UP can be found next to the new domain.

Next, click ‘Add’ to create a new deployment rule. Fill in the appropriate fields.

The deployment is now listed under ‘Subdomain creation rules’

### Use-cases for deployments

- Host your staging servers on your own domain to make them easier to find. `staging.demo.example.com` could be bookmarked by a QA person to see the latest commit on the `staging` branch.
- Run your backend and frontend in different Layerfiles and combine them behind one host (`main.demo.example.com` and `main.demo.example.com/api` respectively)
- Allow multiple subdomains to the same Layerfile in case your application does host based routing (e.g., `dashboard.main.demo.example.com`)
- Private Deployments which prevents people from outside your organizations from viewing your site

By default, [EXPOSE WEBSITE](/docs/layerfile-reference/expose-website) creates staging servers are at `https://(uuid).cidemo.co`, where the uuid is unique for every Layerfile. The deployments page lets you customize this by adding a column to its table and adding a `CNAME` record on a domain you control.

### Subdomains within deployments

Subdomains are preconfigured in webapp.io. Your webserver always sees the host as localhost. If you don’t want that to be the case, please contact support.

For example, say you have a deployment at deployment.demo.webapp.io. If you then go to hello.deployment.demo.webapp.io, it will go to the same deployment. Similarly, if you navigate to greetings.deployment.demo.webapp.io, it will also direct to deployment.demo.webapp.io. This happens by default.

### Two layerfile polyrepo example

- In this example, the backend and frontend are separate repositories, and we want to use the latest version of the frontend whenever the backend is built.

##### (backend repo)/layerfiles/backend/Layerfile

```Layerfile
# backend
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# install the latest version of Docker, as in the official Docker installation tutorial.
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common && \
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add - && \
    add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable" && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt install docker-ce

COPY / .
RUN REPEATABLE docker build -t backend && docker run -d -p 80:80 backend

EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:80 /api
```

##### (backend repo)/layerfiles/frontend/Layerfile

<div className="section-spacing"></div>
```Layerfile
# backend

    chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/fast-git-download

# download the latest version of the frontend's "master" branch and build and start it.
RUN REPEATABLE fast-git-download frontend-repo-name /frontend origin/master && \
    cd /frontend && \
    docker build -t frontend && docker run -d -p 80:80 frontend

EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:80
```

##### Deployments

1. Create a single deployment from $branch.demo.yourdomain.com to the backend repository, leave the branch field empty

2. Create a CNAME record from *.demo to demotarget.webapp.io

3. Push the layerfiles above to a branch, say, "main"

4. Visit main.demo.yourdomain.com - notice that requests to main.demo.yourdomain.com/api/hello go to the backend layerfile, while requests to main.demo.yourdomain.com go to the frontend layerfile (within the backend domain)
