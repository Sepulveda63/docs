# WAIT

`WAIT [layerfile paths...]`

The `WAIT` instruction allows you to make one step require other steps to succeed before running.

It's especially useful for conditional actions like executing notifications, deployment, and CI/CD.

### Examples

#### Continuous deployment with WAIT

<pre>
    <code class="language-html CodeHighlight">
        # at deploy/Layerfile
        FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04
        
        # Wait for the layerfiles at /unit-tests/Layerfile and /acceptance-tests/Layerfile
        WAIT /unit-tests /acceptance-tests
        
        RUN ./notify-slack.sh
        RUN ./deploy.sh
    </code>
</pre>

<br />

#### Conditional deployment with WAIT and BUTTON

<pre>
    <code class="language-html CodeHighlight">
        # at deploy/Layerfile
        FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04
        
        # Wait for the layerfiles at /unit-tests/Layerfile and /acceptance-tests/Layerfile
        WAIT /unit-tests /acceptance-tests
        
        RUN ./notify-slack.sh
        BUTTON deploy?
        RUN ./deploy.sh
    </code>
</pre>

#### What the job view will look like with WAIT

- Notice that deploy only occurs after all of the other layerfiles have succeeded.
